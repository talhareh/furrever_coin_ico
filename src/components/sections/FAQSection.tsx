                  <li>âœ… Renounced Contract - The contract is fully renounced, meaning it's 100% decentralized and transparent. No single party has control, ensuring fair play for all holders.</li>
                  <li>âœ… Community-Driven - There are no taxes, no hidden fees, and no centralized control. The power lies entirely with the community, making it a true grassroots project.</li>
                  <li>âœ… Supporting Animal Shelters - FurreverCoin isn't just another meme coin. It aims to make a real-world impact by supporting animal shelters and causes that matter.</li>
                  <li>âœ… Meme Coin Magic - It embraces the fun and viral nature of meme coins, backed by an enthusiastic and like-minded community.</li>
